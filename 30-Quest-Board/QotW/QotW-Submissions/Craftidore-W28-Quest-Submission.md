> As you close in on a small town called Ramshorn, you come across a mansion-esque house about a mile from the town proper. 
> It's front door slams as a 16 year old girl stomps out. 
> Upon seeing you, she holds out an expensive looking ring. 
> 
> > "Y'all look dangerous," she says with a slight southern drawl. "I'll pay ya 5 gold to smash this ring to bits."
> 
> An older woman, her mother presumably, stomps out immediately after.
> 
> > "Esmeralda, you *will* marry Harry; you've already been promised to him. You can't just decide you don't want to.
> 
> Ring still in hand, Esmeralda turns around, glaring daggers at her mother, then stomps inside.
> The mother sighs.
> 
> > "I'm sorry; not a very nice welcome to Ramshorn. 
> > I'm sorry about my daughter; she's been arranged to be married to Harry Thornson, the son of the mayor of the town west of here. 
> > The two of them were really hitting it off, but then she went to visit him at his parents estate and learned he met the large ferocious dog he keeps as a pet. 
> > Esmeralda is terrified of dogs... and now she refuses to see Harry, much less marry him. 
> > I can't talk sense into her.

> She looks at your attire and weapons, and her eyes light up with an idea.
> 
> > "Could I perhaps hire you to, subtly of course, 'remove' Harry's dog from the equation?" she asks. "It would pay handsomely."

> [!tip]+
> From here, hopefully the PCs will be interested enough to investigate further. 
> Whether they just want to find Esmeralda and destroy her ring, opt for the more difficult (but probably better paying) murder-the-dog job, or decide to go in a completely different direction, just roll with it. 
> 
> My goal here is to make each character motivation crystal clear for you as the GM, which should let you figure out how they'd respond to whatever your PCs end up doing.
> 
> Finally there's a section with 'key info' that might change the players actions or inform their plans.
> It's up to you how you want to reveal this info, but remember that the players don't actually have to find all this out, it's just things that they *could* find out.

> [!example] Key Info
> - Markus Thornson (Harry's Father) has threatened that his family will take over rule of this town, either by force or by joining lines. Mary chose to marry Esmeralda off to Harry over violence, hence why she's willing to go to such drastic measures
