# Quest of the Week
I don't really have a solid #dungeon23 but just make more stuff and I think this would be something I can share on how my process of creating a quest. I would post the list of quests in here. These are generated by dataview plugin. 

```dataview
table 
from "30-Quest-Board/QotW"
sort cdate
```

## Manual Update
Sig suggested I could track what was the quest and exclude them from the list to keep it from duplication. I will start doing that with W26 since I switched to single objective 

| Week | Quest            |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| 26   | Attack Location  |
| 27   | Persuade Item    |
| 28   | Destroy Item     |
| 29   | Deceive Event    |
| 30   | DeliverÂ Creature |
