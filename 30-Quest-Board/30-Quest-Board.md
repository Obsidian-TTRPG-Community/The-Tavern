# Welcome to Jethoof's Emporium of Requests

# Introduction 
There's a human in the corner of the tavern sipping his drink from a strange looking iron flask decorated with colorful braided threads. Behind him rests a large wooden board with various pieces of notices; one written on a parchment with rich blue black ink with a intricate seal, a torn leather piece with notice written in dried blood and a wanted poster. 

"Looking for some extra coins in your pockets or just something to kill time with?" The human chuckles and strums the table with his fingers. "If you fancy some coins while you are waiting for your companions to finish their business, here's one about slaying a beast that's terrorizing a local village. If slaying isn't your thing, a merchant over there is looking for someone to protect him from highwaymen and beasts during his travel to the next stop." The man scans your outfit.

"Perhaps the mundane things of this world isn't really for you eh? I might have something...extra. Extra-ordinary requests from more peculiar part of the realms if you are... courageous or crazy enough to hop in to them." The man chuckles gestures his left, a thin black flowing curtain peppered with white specs resembling a night sky glides over to a wall. Upon close inspection the specs twinkled like stars and you can feel a breeze blowing beyond the curtain. 

"Not the curtain, the thing behind the curtain." The man stands up to slightly reveal the curtain; a small office with many doors comes to a view. As you walk through the curtain, the man follows behind you. 

"Welcome to Jethoof's Emporium of Requests." He bows gracefully, here are some of the requests from the multiverse looking for brave traveler like yourself to solve their conundrums. They are willing to reward you handsomely should you solve their troubles.  Feel free to examine the doors, they come with their wish list to be fulfilled. To accept the request, you just simply need to enter." ^f97790

# Quest Board
I know you have the big idea of heroes saving the world from certain doom and sometimes there can be some event the heroes stumble upon during their journey. Perhaps this is the main course for your campaign.  There are many reference books out there you can use to draw inspiration from and this is my method of generating events. These can be used for you to generate the main, sub and side plots when you feel you are stuck. 

[[Quest-Table]] is my go to table when I want or need some inspiration on what kind of elements to use. It is left vague for you to fill in the details since your world setting would be different from my world.

![[Quest-Table#^dice1]]

I will provide some of the examples I have based on the result of the tables I have. Also feel free to expand the table on your own to make it more complicated. Which will be covered in [[Creating Complex Tables]]

> [!example] Botched Binding (Prompt: [[Quest-Table#^dice1|Aid Event]])
> ### 
> A dire bear, severely wounded, barreled through the woods and ambushed the party. Once defeated a ranger comes through, drenched in sweat and tired looking complains it was his catch and the party ruined his ritual of binding. He introduces himself as [name here], a spirit binder, and was in a middle of challenging the creature in a ritual of binding to become his spirit companion. The creature was already causing trouble in the nearby village and he thought it would have been fine as long as he was able to bind the creature's spirit under his command. 
> 
> Now the ritual has been disrupted, he demands the party to help him to bind another and it did cost him some pretty copper to boot. If the party agrees to help, he would mention there's a bigger prey that the nearby village might be helped from, a frost worm called the Cleaver. The ranger offers two things, 
> - A safe passage from the prying eyes of the Scarlet Boar 
> - Ritual of Binding is for Rangers homebrew spell.

This side story was actually used in one of my campaign for a filler episode in between story arcs.
