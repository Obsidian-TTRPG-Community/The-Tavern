Elves (and fantasy species in general) live *way* longer than humans.
There are two main questions this raises:

1. How can some rational species living 7-10 times longer than others be justified?
2. What are the implications of species with exceedingly long lives?

## How is this justified?

The Grungeon Master points to sharks as the best real-world analogue to century-living creatures (they are actually aware of their surroundings, unlike barely animate creatures who also live that long). 
Sharks live very active lives, which makes them best among the long-lived animals to compare to.
Sharks, however, have cells that mutate less frequently and less drastically than humans, which marine biologists believe aids in their longevity.
This proves that long-lived species don't *have* to live sedentary lifestyles&mdash;perhaps elves have cells which mutate less. 

This brings up a problem: in most fantasy, there are many different kinds of elves. 
This doesn't make any sense though, if their cells don't mutate frequently or drastically.
The only explanation is some sort of magical mutations (which is a bit of a cop-out answer) or elves have existed in the world for hundreds to thousands of times as long as other species.
The better explanation is not that natural selection caused different elf subspecies, but elven magical abilities are merely directly shaped by the environment around them, **intentionally** adapting to it.

Contrast this with dwarves and gnomes: these two mirror 'human ideals.' 
In the case of dwarves, they have a very structured lifestyle and a driven purpose&mdash;things that we associate with longevity. Gnomes represent keeping your mind sharp and hands busy, as they constantly tinker into their old age.

## What are the implications?

First, what superstitions would exist around species' longevity. 
Science usually isn't a driving force in fantasy, so what do people believe makes elves live so wrong, even if their beliefs are incorrect.
One idea The Grungeon Master has is that because Gnomes always are tinkering, people would assume  that as long as a gnome's hands and mind are busy their physical body would keep up. An implication would be that imprisoned gnomes would be treated differently, their guards making sure they always had something to do with their hands lest they keel over and die.
Another thought is that elves are treated as great historians, vestiges of what the world once was. Yet Elves would be very bad at recounting what the past was like, due to their insular nature.

Other implications are that long-lived species would value long-lasting tools much *much* more than the shorter-lived ones. 
No wonder dwarven- and elven-crafted weapons, armor, and tools are so sought after.
Furthermore, elves are probably either expected to switch careers multiple times in their lifetime (perhaps even intentionally purging memories of their 'past lives') or become *the best* at what they do, bar none.

The Grungeon Master speculates that long-lived species like elves would have labor laws much sooner, as the insanity of working every day for centuries would be a much bigger problem in elvish society.
Dwarvish societies likely also have much better health and safety regulations. 
Because an early dwarven death is much more tragic than an early human one, safety in the mines would be a much greater concern&mdash;unless safety were such a high concern, it would be expected that any dwarf working in the mines would die there, by simple inevitability, over the length of their lives.

Imagine the effect of a diplomat from a long lived species. 
The Grungeon Master points out that a mere 3 elven diplomats could recount with eyewitness testimony the entire history of England from its roots.
Having such a diplomat as an advisor would be an overwhelmingly useful tool in a monarchs arsenal.

- This worldbuilding about elves, dwarves, and gnomes takes what would otherwise be a [[OSP--Planet-of-Hats|Planet of Hats]] description of a race and instead gives it depth. Even if you don't agree with the speculations he has, it's inspiring to see depth added to such... basic species stereotypes.
