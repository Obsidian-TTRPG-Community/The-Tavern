The 'Planet of Hats' is a storytelling trope in which an entire planet/species/culture/etc. will be entirely defined by one-two specific traits or quirks. The quick examples Red gives are

- Warrior race (Klingons)
- Pacifist race (something star wars?)
- People-who-ride-horses-a-lot race (I don't know)
- Everyone-wears-a-funny-hat race (something futurama)
- Hippie-druid race (Avatar)

This shows up in D&D too, with elves being either pretentious jerks or nature-loving hippies, dwarves as sturdy miners and craftsmen, and orcs as beefy tribal warriors.
This also applies to cultures that are just copy-pasted existing historical cultures.

This trope is *usually* not one talked about in a positive light. 
It's certainly convenient from a worldbuilding standpoint, as it lets you create a distinct race without all the trouble of having to actually be creative, but also lets you tell your players (or readers) a lot about a race or culture without having to explicitly explain it all.
Despite the convenience, using this trope typically makes a race or culture *shallow.*
Perhaps that's a worthwhile trade for a culture that only matters in a one-off filler session, but when working with a larger world, you want something deeper than that.

Now, a species or culture having some sort of identity or pattern isn't what makes planet of the hats shallow. 
Instead, Planet of the Hats occurs when the pattern a culture fits into is prescriptive instead of descriptive.
Tolkien's elves and dwarves a great example of worldbuilding done well, because while stereotypes exist for dwarves and elves, their societies were much more complex than that. Dwarves were stereotyped as miners and warriors, but they had complex societies, and individual dwarves are more than just the stereotype (and even exist outside the stereotype). Elves likewise had the stereotype of being elegant, wiser, and relics of a better time.
This pretty obviously *isn't* something that defines every member of their culture: just look at Legolas, an elf who enjoys living in the world and being a part of the action.
Their is depth to these cultures beyond what their 'hat' supposedly is.

Finally, Red goes over a quick step-by-step guide to worldbuilding a culture. I won't reiterate it here, but the timestamp is [10:01](https://youtu.be/isdaYjET9cg?t=601).
